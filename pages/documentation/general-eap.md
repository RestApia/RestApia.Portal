# What is _Early Access Program_ (EAP)?

The **Early Access Program (EAP)** offers an opportunity to use the early version of RestApia while it is still under active development. During this phase, you can explore all features and functionalities for **_free_** and **_without any limitations_**, whether for personal or commercial purposes. The EAP version will be available until a specified end date, giving you a chance to experience and provide feedback on the latest features.

## What Is Included?
- **Full Access:** You get complete access to all current features of RestApia, without any restrictions.
- **Commercial Use Allowed:** Feel free to use the EAP version in any environment, including for commercial projects.
- **No Cost:** The Early Access version is available to everyone at no charge until the end of the EAP period.

## When Does EAP End?
The EAP period runs until a specific end date, which is displayed in the installed version of the application at the bottom right side of the window as 'EAP until year-month-day'. The EAP period may be prolonged with a new version, but after the end date, the EAP version will stop working. You will need to install the regular version, or switch to it automatically. You will receive updates about this transition as the final release approaches.

## How Can You Benefit?
The Early Access Program is a great way to:
- **Explore Features:** Test out all available features without any limitations.
- **Influence Development:** Your feedback during this period is valuable and can help shape the future of RestApia.
- **Get a Head Start:** Familiarize yourself with RestApia's features before the official release, allowing you to hit the ground running once the full version launches.

## How to Participate
Simply follow the instructions on the [Download and Install](/pages/documentation/general-install) page, and start exploring. There's no sign-up required, and you are free to use it as you see fit until the EAP period end.

## Important Notice
This is an early version of RestApia, which means some bugs or missing features might be present. Your understanding and feedback are greatly appreciated as we work to improve the application.

Enjoy using RestApia in the Early Access Program and help shape its future!
