# Download and Install

RestApia is designed as a _cross-platform_ application, with planned support for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Currently, _RestApia_ is available only on **Windows** during this Early Access phase.

As we work toward a Stable release, expanding to other platforms is a top priority. Once RestApia reaches stability, support for Linux and macOS will be among the next major updates.
Thank you for your patience as we develop support across all platforms!

## Installation on Windows

RestApia is available for installation via the [Windows Package Manager (winget)](https://aka.ms/winget). To get started, simply open a terminal and use the following command:

```bash
winget install RestApia
```

This will automatically download and install RestApia on your machine. After the installation is complete, you can launch the application from your desktop or terminal.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**  
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open Command Prompt.
   - Alternatively, search for **Terminal** in your Start menu.

2. **Run the Install Command**  
   - In your terminal, type the install command provided earlier and hit Enter.

3. **Wait for Installation to Complete**  
   - The installation process will take a few moments. Once completed, RestApia will be installed and ready to use.

4. **Launch RestApia**  
   - After the installation completes, **RestApia** will launch automatically. You can also find it later in your Start menu or use the desktop icon that has been added.
