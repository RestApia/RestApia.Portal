# *RestApia* Extensions

**RestApia** is continuously evolving, and we're excited to announce that **extension support** is planned for future updates! Extensions will enable users to expand the app’s functionality and tailor it to their specific needs.

## Planned Features for Extensions

Extensions will bring a range of additional features to enhance **RestApia**:

- **Authorization Options**: Add support for more types of authorization, beyond what’s available by default.
- **Secrets Management**: Import secrets from external sources securely, making API testing even more flexible.
- **Collection Imports**: Easily import collections from other API tools, allowing smoother transitions and integrations.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Integrate with external services for collection synchronization, improved team collaboration, and more. We’re exploring options for integrations with platforms like GitHub, cloud storage services, and CI/CD tools.

We’re excited to see how you will use these powerful tools to enhance your API testing experience.

## User-Developed and Official Extensions

RestApia will support both **official extensions** and **user-developed extensions**:

- **Official Extensions**: These will be maintained by the RestApia team and provide trusted, highly-requested features.
- **User-Developed Extensions**: Users will be able to create and manage their own extensions. More details about the process for adding and managing user-developed extensions will be provided as we finalize the implementation.

## Managing Extensions

Once extension support is available, users will be able to manage extensions directly from the **RestApia** settings:

- **Free Extensions**: Available for all users, providing core enhancements without any cost.
- **Premium Extensions**: Available to users on the **Team** and **Enterprise** plans, offering advanced functionality for professional or collaborative environments.
- **Private Extensions**: Designed specifically for **Enterprise** users, private extensions will allow companies to create custom extensions that are available exclusively for their own users within their organization.

## Stay Tuned for Updates

Extensions are currently in beta, and while the documentation is still in progress, you can explore examples and find inspiration in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/RestApia/RestApia.Shared/tree/main/src/Extensions).
