# Workspace Management

_RestApia_ helps you organize your projects with easy-to-use workspace management. Workspaces are folders on your computer where all the related files are saved. This makes it simple to keep everything together. You can have multiple workspaces to organize different APIs, all combined under one project.

## Structuring Your Workspaces

Each workspace has everything you need for API testing and development:

- **Requests**: Create and store your API requests in your workspace. You can easily edit, run, and manage these requests.
- **Folders for Grouping**: Make folders inside your workspace to group requests by their purpose or by API. This keeps things neat and makes it easier to find what you need, especially for bigger projects with many APIs.
