# Quick Search

*Quick Search* in _RestApia_ is a powerful tool to help you quickly locate any request in your project. This feature appears as an overlay when you press **Double Shift** or **F1** (can be customized in the settings).

## How It Works

- **Recent Requests**: When you open Quick Search, it first displays your recently opened requests for easy access.
- **Search by Name**: Start typing to instantly search through your requests by name, allowing you to navigate large projects effortlessly.
