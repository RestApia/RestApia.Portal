# Structured Responses

*RestApia* provides an intuitive interface for working with API responses through **Structured Responses**. When a request is sent, RestApia displays various components to help you understand the response thoroughly and easily.

## Response Content and More

- **Response Viewer**: View response content, formatted neatly in JSON or XML with syntax highlighting for better readability.
- **Headers and Cookies**: Access detailed lists of both request and response headers, as well as any cookies involved in the transaction.
- **Available Variables**: See all available variables for the current request, allowing you to reuse and understand dynamic parts of your API calls.
- **Timeline View**: Track every step of the request, including which endpoint was called, response length, type, status, and total execution time.
