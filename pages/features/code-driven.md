# Code-Driven Definition

*RestApia* takes a code-driven approach to defining API requests, making it a powerful tool for developers who prefer working with code instead of form-based UIs. This approach provides flexibility and control, along with an intuitive, developer-friendly interface.

## Writing Requests Like Code

RestApia allows you to define your API requests using a simple editor with built-in features like *syntax highlighting* and *text completion*.

## Why Code-Driven Requests?

- **User Friendly**: Built for developers who are accustomed to writing and reading code, while also offering an easy-to-understand structure for anyone needing to perform API testing.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Everything you need is conveniently in one place, making it easy to manage. You can comment, modify, and share all details seamlessly, with just a simple copy-paste.
- **More Control**: Code-driven requests provide more control and flexibility than form-based UIs, allowing to define every detail of their request.
