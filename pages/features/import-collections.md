# Import Collections

*RestApia* makes it easy to import collections from other API tools, allowing you to quickly get started without rebuilding everything from scratch. The **Import Collections** feature supports importing directly into an existing workspace or creating a new one.

## Supported Formats

- **Postman Collection v2.1**: RestApia includes an official extension that supports importing collections from Postman, making transitions smoother.
- **Extension-Based Imports**: RestApia's extension system allows developers to add support for additional collection formats. This means you can extend RestApia's capabilities based on your needs.

## How It Works

- Simply drag and drop your collection file or use the file selector to choose the collection you want to import.
- You can choose the source format and the target workspace to customize where and how the collection is added.
