# Sending Feature Requests

Do you have a brilliant idea or a feature you'd love to see in **RestApia**? We’re always looking for ways to improve the app, and your input is invaluable! Follow the steps below to submit a feature request through our GitHub repository.

## Steps to Submit a Feature Request

1. **Go to the GitHub Issues Page**  
   Navigate to our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/RestApia/RestApia.Community/issues).

2. **Check for Existing Requests**  
   Before submitting a new feature request, take a moment to check if someone has already suggested a similar idea. If they have, feel free to add your thoughts or suggestions in the comments.

3. **Create a New Feature Request**  
   If your idea isn’t listed, click on the **"New Issue"** button. You’ll be presented with a template that guides you through submitting your request. This template will ask for:

   - **What's the Challenge?**  
     Describe the problem you're facing or a gap in the current features.

   - **Vision for the Solution**  
     Share your vision of the new feature and how it would work. Be as creative as you like!

4. **Submit Your Feature Request**  
   Once you've filled out the details, click on **Submit new issue** to send your request. Our team will review and consider your idea for future updates.

## Priority for Team and Enterprise Plans

While all feature requests are valued, users on **Team** and **Enterprise** plans will have more priority when it comes to reviewing and implementing requests. These users also benefit from more direct support to discuss and refine their ideas. For more information on upgrading to these plans, check out our [Pricing page](/pages/pricing).

## Stay Updated

You can follow the discussion thread for your feature request on GitHub to see any progress or updates. We’ll notify you if your idea is selected for development or if we need further clarification.

## Thank You!

We love hearing from our community and are excited to see how we can make **RestApia** even better with your ideas. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/FZuQyEpYM4).
