# _RestApia_: Cross-Platform Vision

RestApia is designed as a cross-platform application, with planned support for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. Currently, _RestApia_ is available only on **Windows** during this Early Access phase.

## Future Platform Support

As we work toward a Stable release, expanding to other platforms is a top priority. Once RestApia reaches stability, support for Linux and macOS will be among the next major updates.

Thank you for your patience as we develop support across all platforms!
