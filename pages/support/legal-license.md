# RestApia End-User License Agreement

## 1. License Scope and Usage Restrictions

- **Free Plan (Personal Use Only)**: The Free Plan is strictly for individual, non-commercial projects. Usage within any commercial organization or for profit-driven projects is prohibited. However, educational institutions are permitted to use the Free Plan for teaching and training purposes within their organizations, provided that such use is non-commercial (e.g., not used in paid educational programs).

- **Team Plan**: Provides access to RestApia for commercial use within smaller teams, with limitations on certain features compared to the Enterprise Plan (e.g., limited access to advanced analytics and integrations). For detailed features and pricing, see the RestApia [Pricing Page](/pages/pricing).

- **Enterprise Plan**: Designed for larger organizations, the Enterprise Plan includes access to all standard features of RestApia. Some future cloud services may be provided at an additional cost. For detailed features and pricing, see the RestApia [Pricing Page](/pages/pricing).

- **Exceptional Access**: RestApia reserves the right to issue time-limited or perpetual licenses to specific clients at its discretion, under terms mutually agreed upon with those clients.

## 4. Termination
