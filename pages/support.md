# Support

We’re here to help! Whether you’ve encountered a bug, have a feature request, or just need assistance, **RestApia** offers several ways to get support.

## Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

All users can easily report bugs or send us feature requests via GitHub. We encourage you to visit our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/RestApia/RestApia.Community/issues) where you can:

- **Report a Bug**: Found an issue? Let us know by submitting a bug report. Check out our [How to Report a Bug](/pages/docs/how-to-report-bug) guide for step-by-step instructions.
- **Submit a Feature Request**: Have a great idea to make RestApia even better? Share it with us! Visit the [Sending Feature Requests](/pages/docs/how-to-request-feature) page to learn how to submit your ideas.

## Additional Support for Team and Enterprise Plans

Users on the **Team** and **Enterprise** plans receive additional attention to their requests. This includes higher priority for feature requests and direct communication channels for a more responsive support experience.

For more information on upgrading to a Team or Enterprise plan, check out our [Pricing page](/pages/pricing).
